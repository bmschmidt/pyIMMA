A python API for IMMA data
==========================

The observations in the `International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere DataSet (ICOADS) <http://icoads.noaa.gov/>`_, are in the `International Meteorological Maritime Archive (IMMA) format <http://icoads.noaa.gov/e-doc/imma/>`_. This package provides a python API for using data in the IMMA format.

This is not an official ICOADS product. There is `official software for IMMA <http://icoads.noaa.gov/software/>`_, but only in Fortran.

This software supports all of IMMA version 0. Version 1 is not currently supported.
